1. Minimize the added water and ions
2. Heat up the system from 100 K under constant volume
3. Relax the system at a constant pressure
4. Lower the restraints on the system
5. Minimize the system with restraints just on the backbone of the molecule
6. Relax system at a constant pressure with backbone restraints
7. Reduce the backbone restraint force
8. Continue to reduce the backbone restraint force.
9. Relax the system with no restraints
